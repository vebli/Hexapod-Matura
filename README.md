# Hexapod Robot - Matura Thesis Project
This project was created as part of my Matura thesis (November 2023).  
The goal was to build a simple walking robot and, in the process, teach myself the basics of:

- CAD software for mechanical design
- Electronics and circuit building
- Arduino programming for embedded control

This was my first attempt at a complete robotics project. While the code and design are far from perfect, it reflects the starting point of my interest in robotics and embedded systems.
